# sendMails
### - This script sends mails to domains provided from input file via cli arg '-f'.
### - It appends "security@" to the domain and sends it using gmail smtp.
### - It maintains logs of both, mail which got sent successfully and of those which didn't. 
### - Before sending new mails it checks if the mail was previously sent (in logs) then it skips the domain.

## This was only for testing purposes.
